## Overview
Codex is a sovereign, zero-knowledge, post-quantum cryptographic framework designed specifically for Indigenous governance and data sovereignty.  
This prototype demonstrates a working implementation for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections within First Nations communities.

---

## Included Files
- `generate_credential.py`: Generates anonymous, zero-knowledge credentials for voters.
- `submit_vote.py`: Allows voters to securely submit votes using ZK credentials.
- `audit_votes.py`: Provides transparent auditing capability without compromising voter anonymity.
- `TetraChain.json`: Ledger file to store vote hashes securely (auto-generated).
- `scripts/deploy_codex_podman.sh`: Podman-based container deployment script.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Optional: Podman (for container-based deployment)

---

## Setup & Usage

### Step 1: Generate Voter Credential
Run the script providing a Band ID and a personal secret:

```bash
python3 generate_credential.py [band_id] [secret]
```

### Step 2: Submit Vote
Submit a vote anonymously using the credential hash generated:

```bash
python3 submit_vote.py [credential_hash] [vote_choice]
```

### Step 3: Audit Votes
Audit all votes submitted to ensure transparency and integrity:

```bash
python3 audit_votes.py
```

---

## Features
- âœ… Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Groth16/STARK): Ensures privacy, uniqueness, and verifiability.
- âœ… Decentralized & Sovereign: No cloud, no central authority.
- âœ… Tamper-Proof Ledger: Cryptographically secure vote history.
- âœ… Offline Operation: Supports USB/air-gapped deployment.

---

## Application
Ideal for:
- Chief & Council elections
- Referendums & community governance
- MÃ©tis and Urban Indigenous advisory elections
- Indigenous self-determined data sovereignty initiatives

---

## ðŸ”§ Deployment with Podman

You can deploy Codex as a secure offline container using Podman:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy_codex_podman.sh
./scripts/deploy_codex_podman.sh
```

This will:
- Build the container from source
- Mount a persistent volume for TetraChain vote ledger
- Run the node locally at `http://localhost:5000`

Thank you for considering this innovative Indigenous solution for the SK-NEIHR Spring Institute.

May our elections be as sacred as our voices.

TetraCodex:
Final Combination of the components listed below.

License: Apache 2.0.

Description: TetraCodex serves as the core foundation for TetraNexus, integrating multiple cryptographic protocols for sovereign, quantum-safe communication. It uses elements of post-quantum cryptography and decentralized networks to provide a secure and resilient infrastructure.

TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus:
License: Apache 2.0.

Description: This project is a post-quantum encryption system based on hyperdimensional Platonic geometry. It includes Tetrahedral Key Exchange, Quantum Dodecahedral Encryption, and Recursive Tesseract Hashing (RTH) for secure communications in quantum environments.

TetraYggdrasil_Nexus:
License: MIT.

Description: This component focuses on post-quantum communication, specifically zk-STARK Authentication and WASM-Optimized P2P Mesh Networking using Yggdrasil. It enables decentralized, peer-to-peer communication while ensuring quantum-safe standards.

TetraCrypt_Yggdrasil_Unified:
License: MIT.

Description: A unified communication framework built on TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus and TetraYggdrasil_Nexus, combining zk-STARK authentication and WASM-optimized mesh networking for quantum-safe communications.

TetraNexus:
License: Apache 2.0.

Description: The centralized network that combines all the aforementioned components. It provides a sovereign quantum-safe network, using zkSNARKs, Poseidon hashing, recursive tesseract hashing (RTH), and Platonic geometry (QIDL) for secure, decentralized quantum-safe communication.

TetraVote:
License: MIT.

Description: A sovereign voting framework built on TetraCodex, TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus, and TetraNexus. It enables tamper-proof elections for Indigenous nations, ensuring quantum-safe encryption in the democratic process.

How These Projects Connect:
TetraCodex is the foundation that integrates the features of TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus, TetraYggdrasil_Nexus, TetraCrypt_Yggdrasil_Unified, TetraNexus, and TetraVote.

TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus provides quantum-safe encryption methods, which are used in TetraCodex and TetraNexus.

TetraYggdrasil_Nexus offers the decentralized communication framework, which is integrated into TetraCodex for secure P2P communication.

TetraCrypt_Yggdrasil_Unified brings the mesh networking and quantum-safe authentication that combine with the other components to create a full-stack solution.

TetraVote is a subset of TetraCodex, focusing on sovereign voting systems based on quantum-safe principles and cryptography.

Licensing Clarifications:
TetraCodex, TetraNexus, and TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus are under Apache 2.0, making them compatible for enterprise and commercial use.

TetraYggdrasil_Nexus and TetraCrypt_Yggdrasil_Unified are under MIT, offering flexibility for community-driven projects and open-source contributions.
