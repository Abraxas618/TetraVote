## 🧭 Overview

**TetraVote** is a zero-knowledge, post-quantum voting framework created to empower Indigenous nations with sovereign, tamper-proof, and transparent elections.  
It operates without reliance on cloud services or centralized infrastructure, enabling **air-gapped**, **offline**, and **containerized deployments**.

This prototype was proposed late to SK-NEIHR as a real-world application of Indigenous Data Sovereignty and secure digital governance using zero-trust mathematics.
I am not enrolled in any graduate studies but want to contribute to SK-NEIHR Vision of Indigenous Data Sovereignty. I currently have Grade 12 Self-Taught Post-Quantum Cryptography with Zero Knowledge Proof, etc. TetraVote is designed following post-quantum principles — decentralized, air-gapped, identity-blind, and ledger-based — but the current prototype uses classical cryptographic primitives (e.g., SHA-256) and standard credential structures.
Future iterations are intended to integrate true post-quantum encryption (Kyber key exchange, lattice signatures) and zero-knowledge SNARK proofs once those libraries are fully modularized for offline First Nations deployments.

## 🧩 Application Context

Ideal for:
- Chief & Council elections
- Land Code Referendums
- Métis and Urban Indigenous advisory board elections
- Nation-wide sovereignty tech pilots
- Community-focused voting in areas with low infrastructure

---

## 🐧 Podman Deployment (Optional)

Run the entire TetraVote system as a container for secure, isolated deployment:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy_codex_podman.sh
./scripts/deploy_codex_podman.sh
```

## ✨ A Note from the Developer

> TetraVote was created in under 30 days as a proof that sovereign cryptography and Indigenous governance can walk side-by-side into the future.  
> It’s more than code — it’s a ceremony written in mathematics.  
>  
> May our elections be as sacred as our voices.

## TetraCodex: Final Combination of the components listed below.

License: Apache 2.0.

Description: TetraCodex serves as the core foundation for TetraNexus, integrating multiple cryptographic protocols for sovereign, quantum-safe communication. It uses elements of post-quantum cryptography and decentralized networks to provide a secure and resilient infrastructure.

TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus: License: Apache 2.0.

Description: This project is a post-quantum encryption system based on hyperdimensional Platonic geometry. It includes Tetrahedral Key Exchange, Quantum Dodecahedral Encryption, and Recursive Tesseract Hashing (RTH) for secure communications in quantum environments.

TetraYggdrasil_Nexus: License: MIT.

Description: This component focuses on post-quantum communication, specifically zk-STARK Authentication and WASM-Optimized P2P Mesh Networking using Yggdrasil. It enables decentralized, peer-to-peer communication while ensuring quantum-safe standards.

TetraCrypt_Yggdrasil_Unified: License: MIT.

Description: A unified communication framework built on TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus and TetraYggdrasil_Nexus, combining zk-STARK authentication and WASM-optimized mesh networking for quantum-safe communications.

TetraNexus: License: Apache 2.0.

Description: The centralized network that combines all the aforementioned components. It provides a sovereign quantum-safe network, using zkSNARKs, Poseidon hashing, recursive tesseract hashing (RTH), and Platonic geometry (QIDL) for secure, decentralized quantum-safe communication.

TetraVote: License: MIT.

Description: A sovereign voting framework built on TetraCodex, TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus, and TetraNexus. It enables tamper-proof elections for Indigenous nations, ensuring quantum-safe encryption in the democratic process.

How These Projects Connect: TetraCodex is the foundation that integrates the features of TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus, TetraYggdrasil_Nexus, TetraCrypt_Yggdrasil_Unified, TetraNexus, and TetraVote.

TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus provides quantum-safe encryption methods, which are used in TetraCodex and TetraNexus.

TetraYggdrasil_Nexus offers the decentralized communication framework, which is integrated into TetraCodex for secure P2P communication.

TetraCrypt_Yggdrasil_Unified brings the mesh networking and quantum-safe authentication that combine with the other components to create a full-stack solution.

TetraVote is a subset of TetraCodex, focusing on sovereign voting systems based on quantum-safe principles and cryptography.

Licensing Clarifications: TetraCodex, TetraNexus, and TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus are under Apache 2.0, making them compatible for enterprise and commercial use.

TetraYggdrasil_Nexus and TetraCrypt_Yggdrasil_Unified are under MIT, offering flexibility for community-driven projects and open-source contributions.
