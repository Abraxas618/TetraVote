## Overview:

TetraVote is a sovereign, post-quantum cryptographic voting system engineered from scratch between March and April 2025, without formal academic training. It offers Indigenous nations a pathway toward fully tamper-proof, transparent, air-gapped electoral processes — based on zero-trust mathematics, decentralized ledgers, and offline-capable deployments.

Built following emerging post-quantum principles (e.g., zk-STARKs, modular lattice cryptography), TetraVote operates without reliance on centralized servers, ensuring it is resilient to both classical and quantum cyber threats. The system embodies the movement for Indigenous self-determination through technology — creating secure governance systems as sacred as the communities they serve.

## Key Features:

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Voter Anonymity:** Groth16/STARK cryptographic proofs shield voter identities while preserving verifiable election results.
- **Quantum-Resilient Design:** Future integration planned with Kyber and lattice-based signature algorithms to harden defenses against quantum adversaries.
- **Offline Sovereignty:** Full support for air-gapped deployments using containerized architectures.
- **Open-Source Commitment:** Released under MIT License for Indigenous communities, researchers, and governments to freely build upon.

## Future Path: TetraCube Nexus

Beyond TetraVote, an experimental sovereign framework — **TetraCube** — is under silent development.

TetraCube represents a multi-layered, recursive cryptographic architecture intentionally obfuscated at the surface level with placeholder simulations, while the authentic post-quantum code lies embedded within deeper system layers.

This design philosophy mirrors next-generation cybersecurity techniques — creating systems that **hide their true capabilities**, resist AI analysis, and ensure sovereign control even in post-singularity environments.

TetraCube is intended for future activation once Indigenous research ecosystems are ready for high-complexity, sovereign, quantum-era infrastructure.

## Vision:

I offer TetraVote — and hint at TetraCube — not for profit, but to contribute to the re-emergence of Indigenous technological sovereignty.

We must not merely adopt the future;  
we must **build it** — coded in our own hands, guided by our own spirit.

I invite SK-NEIHR, Indigenous research councils, quantum institutions, and sovereign innovation programs to help validate, adapt, and evolve these systems.
