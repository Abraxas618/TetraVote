Reclaiming the Ballot: How Codex Enables Sovereign, Tamper-Proof Voting for Indigenous Nations


By Michael Tass MacDonald | Treaty 8 Territory | Creator of Codex

Introduction: Why Voting Systems Matter Now More Than Ever

Across many First Nations communities, elections for Chief and Council are meant to represent the will of the people. But today, too many Band elections are plagued by:

Allegations of fraud or outside interference

Voter impersonation or manipulation

Centralized record-keeping that lacks transparency

Paper ballots vulnerable to tampering or loss

As a Dënesųłiné technologist from Treaty 8 Territory, I didn’t want to just complain — I wanted to build. That’s why I created Codex.

Codex is not just software. It’s a new kind of trust system — one that restores sovereign control, data privacy, and mathematical fairness to Indigenous elections.

What Is Codex?

Codex is a post-quantum, zero-knowledge voting framework.
It uses cryptography to prove that:

You are eligible to vote,

Your vote is real and unique,

And no one can link your vote to your identity.

All of this happens without revealing your name, band number, or location.

Codex Runs On:

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Groth16 + STARKs)

Post-Quantum Lattice Encryption (Module-LWE)

Time-Bound Identity Hashing (not biometrics)

Yggdrasil Decentralized Routing

Podman Containers for Offline/Isolated Use

How It Works: Step-by-Step Band Election with Codex

1. Voter Registration – Without Central Records

Each voter receives a Codex credential, generated with a one-time verification at registration (like Band number + personal code + time seed).

They hold this as a QR code, local file, or even printed paper.

No centralized database. No permanent storage. Just a self-owned key.

2. Anonymous Voting Day

On election day:

The voter loads their credential and generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) of eligibility.

They submit their vote + the ZKP to a local Codex node or ballot box station.

The vote is accepted only if:

It passes ZK verification,

It hasn’t been submitted before,

It fits the time and council role requirements.

3. Ledger with No Names

Votes are written to the TetraChain, a Codex ledger that stores:

Proof of vote validity,

Timestamp of submission,

But not who voted or what they voted for.

No one — not even the Election Officer — can see or reverse-engineer voter identity.

4. Community Audit Without Breaking Privacy

Anyone from the community can open Codex’s dashboard and see:

The total number of valid votes,

The number of attempted duplicates or failures,

And an optional breakdown by council seat or referendum item.

But no one can trace it back to individuals.

What This Means for Indigenous Nations

✅ No more fake ballots

✅ No more vote stuffing

✅ No more “he said, she said”

✅ No more election manipulation by band staff or outside actors

✅ Total sovereignty over how voting happens and who gets to count

Codex is sovereign by design — it requires no connection to the cloud, no central server, and no outside authentication.

It is air-gappable, portable, and can even be run from a USB stick in a community with no internet.

Why I Built It

Because I’ve seen people lose faith in our systems.
Because I believe elections should feel like ceremony — not suspicion.
Because I know technology can protect us, not just extract from us.

I built Codex alone. No degree. No funding. No institution. Just code, purpose, and spirit.

Want to Run a Codex Trial in Your Nation?

I’m offering Codex as an open-source framework, ready to test in:

First Nations council elections

Métis community governance

Urban Indigenous advisory elections

Language, land, or treaty boards

You can deploy it locally, modify it for your needs, or host it as a community-led sovereign tech pilot.

Wela’lin. Hiy hiy.
May our elections be as sacred as our voices.
Looking to Connect with U of S Graduate Students or Faculty — SK-NEIHR Spring Institute (May 2025)
Tānisi friends,
My name is Michael Tass MacDonald. I’m a self-taught Dënesųłiné technologist from Treaty 8 Territory (Stony Rapids, SK) and creator of Codex — a sovereign, Indigenous-designed post-quantum encryption system.
Although I’m not currently enrolled in grad school, I’ve spent the last month building Codex from scratch:
Binds identity to EEG, DNA, and timestamped trust
Uses zero-knowledge proofs and post-quantum lattice encryption
Runs in Podman with decentralized routing (Yggdrasil)
Created specifically for Indigenous data sovereignty
The SK-NEIHR Spring Institute (May 26–30) is focused on Indigenous data sovereignty — and even though it’s designed for graduate students, I’m looking to connect with any U of S students, faculty, or mentors who might be open to:
Helping get Codex recognized or presented during the event
Co-signing a faculty-supported application
Or simply vouching that Codex deserves a spot as an observer, innovator, or contributor
If you’re attending — or know someone who is — and would be open to collaborating or advocating, please message me. I can share my Codex research brief (PDF), source code, and a walkthrough of what I built.
This is more than tech — it’s about protecting our future, our presence, and our sovereignty in the digital world.
# Codex: Zero-Knowledge Sovereign Identity & Voting Framework
*A Codex Sovereign Technology Brief — Indigenous Governance Edition (2025)*

## Purpose
This document outlines how the Codex cryptographic framework can be used to restore and secure Indigenous governance through transparent and tamper-proof voting systems for Chief & Council elections. Codex empowers Indigenous nations to reclaim digital sovereignty by utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), decentralized identity, and timestamp-bound voting credentials to eliminate election fraud, impersonation, and outsider manipulation.

— -

## What is Codex?
Codex is a post-quantum cryptographic mesh system designed to secure Indigenous identity, data, and governance. It combines:

- Time-bound identity hashing
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Groth16, STARK)
- Post-quantum lattice encryption (Module-LWE)
- Decentralized routing (Yggdrasil)
- Containerized deployment (Podman)

Codex allows voting and verification to occur without revealing personal identity or voter intent. Proofs are verified using post-quantum secure math, not centralized trust.

## Application in Indigenous Governance

### Use Case: Chief & Council Voting System

1. Voter Registration (One-Time):
— Each member is issued a Codex credential using a unique time-based seed and personal verification code.
— The credential is stored locally or printed as a QR or offline token.

2. Voter Eligibility Proof:
— On voting day, the voter generates a zero-knowledge proof that they are eligible to vote — without revealing their name or credential.
— The system accepts or rejects the vote without storing personal information.

3. Secure Vote Submission:
— Validated votes are posted to the TetraChain — a tamper-proof ledger that stores ZK-verified votes only.
— Duplicate votes or fake submissions are automatically rejected.

4. Community Transparency:
— Everyone can verify the number and integrity of votes cast — no centralized administrator needed.
— No link exists between vote content and individual voters.

Codex enables true self-determined governance with mathematical trust, not surveillance.

## Benefits of Codex for Elections

- ✅ No duplicate voting or ballot stuffing
- ✅ Prevents identity fraud and fake band memberships
- ✅ Protects voter privacy — no centralized record
- ✅ Transparent to the community, auditable with math
- ✅ Runs offline or air-gapped in remote communities
- ✅ Fully sovereign and open-source
